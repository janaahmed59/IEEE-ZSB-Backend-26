###### **-> What is the difference between a DBMS and an RDBMS?**

DBMS is a software help us to control the DBB, maintain it and Manage data (delete , store, update..,etc.)

A type of DBMS that makes data store in Tables related with Each other with keys and keep data integrity.





###### **-> what is the difference between DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language)? Give one example command for each.**

DDL -> queries for create a structure of the tables and update on it for example -> create , drop , alter

DML -> queries for manipulate data inside tables such as insert , delete , update .





###### **-> why is Normalization important for a large system like a university database?**



Normalization is important for large system because we avoid problems like Insert Anomalies or redundancy which is mean if we have a 1000 student for example in a CS department this means cs Repeated 1000 times !!



we also avoid Update anomalies means if we update a row we have to update all rows in columns that is have a relation with it



we avoid delete anomalies for the same reason of the update ,if we delete a doctor that has fired from college we delete all students' data in his list



so normalization Keep data integrity
